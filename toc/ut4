If L is a language accepted by PDA1 by final state, there exist a PDA2 that accepts L by empty stack i.e. L=L(PDA1)=L(PDA2)
If L is a CFL then there exists a push down automata P accepting CF; ; by empty stack i.e. L=M(P)
Let L is a language accepted by PDA1 then there exist a CFG X such that L(X)=M(P)
