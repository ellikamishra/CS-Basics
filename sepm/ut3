Program Evaluation Review Technique (PERT) is a project management planning tool used to calculate the amount of time it will take to realistically finish a project. PERT charts are used to plan tasks within a project â€” making it easier to schedule and coordinate team members. 
ERT is similar to critical path in that they are both used to visualize the timeline and the work that must be done for a project. However with PERT, you create three different time estimates for the project:

    The shortest possible amount of time each task will take
    The most probable amount of time
    The longest amount of time tasks might take if things don't go as planned

PERT is calculated backward from a fixed end date since contractor deadlines typically cannot be moved.
